PyImgCrawler
============

A simple image crawler written in Python. It downloads multiple image files in one web page, and saves them as their orders.
(Personally I wrote this code to use when I download comics :) ) 

please feel free to use/refer it.

**Updated at Dec. 14 2015** 
- The whole code was re-written, now working with Python 2.7 (not 3.x anymore)
- Improve compatibility for UTF-8 URLs
- Add a exception handling routine when the url starts with '//'
